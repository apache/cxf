VALIDATION_NOT_AN_INTERFACE=The type, {0},  passed in to the build method is not an interface.
VALIDATION_METHOD_WITH_MULTIPLE_VERBS=The client interface contains a method, {0} annotated with more than one HTTP method: {1}
VALIDATION_UNRESOLVED_PATH_PARAMS=The client interface, {0} has one or more methods with unresolved path template variables: {1}
VALIDATION_EXTRA_PATH_PARAMS=The client interface, {0} has one or more extra path segments not in the template: {1}
VALIDATION_ASYNC_METHOD_RETURNS_UNEXPECTED_TYPE=The client interface, {0} has an asynchronous method, {1} that returns an unexpected type, {2}. If the method has an InvocationCallback parameter, then it must be return void.

ASYNC_INTERCEPTOR_EXCEPTION_PREPARE_CONTEXT=The AsyncInvocationInterceptor, {0} has thrown an exception during the invocation of the prepareContext method. This interceptor's applyContext method will not be invoked.
ASYNC_INTERCEPTOR_EXCEPTION_APPLY_CONTEXT=The AsyncInvocationInterceptor, {0} has thrown an exception during the invocation of the applyContext method.
ASYNC_INTERCEPTOR_EXCEPTION_REMOVE_CONTEXT=The AsyncInvocationInterceptor, {0} has thrown an exception during the invocation of the removeContext method.

INVALID_TIMEOUT_PROPERTY=The timeout property, {0} is specified as {1}, and is invalid. It must be a non-negative integer.

CLIENT_HEADER_NO_NAME=A @ClientHeaderParam annotation specified in the {0} interface is invalid because it has a null or empty name.
CLIENT_HEADER_NO_VALUE=A @ClientHeaderParam annotation specified in the {0} interface is invalid because it does not define a valid value attribute.
CLIENT_HEADER_INVALID_COMPUTE_METHOD=A @ClientHeaderParam annotation specified in the {0} interface is invalid because it's value attribute specifies a method, {1}, that does not exist, is not accessible, or contains an incorrect signature. The signature must return a String or String[] and must contain either no arguments or contain exactly one String argument.
CLIENT_HEADER_MULTI_METHOD=A @ClientHeaderParam annotation specified in the {0} interface is invalid because it's value attribute specifies multiple values and at least one of those values is a compute method. If the value attribute specifies a compute method, that must be the only value.
CLIENT_HEADER_COMPUTE_CLASS_NOT_FOUND=A @ClientHeaderParam annotation specified in the {0} interface is invalid because it specifies a compute method on a class that cannot be found.
CLIENT_HEADER_MULTIPLE_SAME_HEADER_NAMES=A @ClientHeaderParam annotation specified in the {0} interface is invalid because it specifies a header name that is already specified on the same target. A header name may only be specified in one @ClientHeaderParam per target.

INVALID_HOSTNAME_VERIFIER_CONFIGURED=The configured hostname verifier, {0} for client interface, {1}, does not exist or is invalid. The class must implement the javax.net.ssl.HostnameVerifier interface and contain a public no-arg constructor.
