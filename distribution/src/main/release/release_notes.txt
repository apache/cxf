Apache CXF 3.0.9 Release Notes

1. Overview

The 3.0.x series of Apache CXF is a significant new version of CXF 
that provides several new features and enhancements.  

New features include: 
Full JAX-RS 2.0 support
New streaming based WS-Security implementation
Bean Validation 1.1
Much easier feature configuration options for JAX-WS
New CXF code generator frontend
Enhanced Reliable-Messaging 1.1 support

As part of the 3.0 refactoring, the runtime has been made smaller, 
many API’s have changed or where relocated, much duplicate 
functionality has been removed, etc…  Thus, 3.0 is not completely
compatible with CXF 2.x and some migration efforts may be required.

Users are encourage to review the migration guide at:

for further information and requirements for upgrading from 2.7.x.

3.0.9 fixes over 24 JIRA issues reported by users and the community.
