== Spring Boot - Samples - CXF Rest Web Services 

This sample project demonstrates how to use CXF JAX-RS services
with Spring Boot. This demo has two JAX-RS class resources being deployed in a single JAX-RS endpoint.  

The sample uses Maven. It can be built and run from the command line:

----
$ mvn -Pserver
----
or
----
$ java -jar target/spring-boot-sample-rs-cxf.jar
----

http://localhost:8080/services/helloservice/sayHello/ApacheCxfUser

will display "Hello ApacheCxfUser, Welcome to CXF RS Spring Boot World!!!"

http://localhost:8080/services/helloservice/sayHello2/ApacheCxfUser

will display "Hello2 ApacheCxfUser, Welcome to CXF RS Spring Boot World!!!"

http://localhost:8080/services/helloservice/swagger.json will return a Swagger JSON
description of services.
