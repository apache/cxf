<h1>CORS</h1>
<p>This package provides a filter to assist applications in implementing Cross Origin Resource Sharing, 
as described in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/cors">CORS specification</a>.
</p>
<h2>CORS Access Model</h2>
<p>
CORS exists to protect web servers from unexpected cross-origin access. The premise of CORS is that many web resources 
are deployed by people who don't want to permit cross-origin access, but who couldn't detect it or didn't bother
to control it. Thus, CORS defines a set of restrictions <em>implemented on the client</em> that, by default, 
prohibit cross-origin access.
</p>
<p>
If you want your service to permit cross-origin access, your service must return additional headers to the client to reassure
it that you really want to permit the access. {@link CrossOriginResourceSharingFilter} adds these headers to your service's 
responses based on rules that you configure.
</p>
<h2>CORS Resource Model (versus JAX-RS)</h2>
<p>
CORS and JAX-RS differ, fundamentally, in how they define a resource for access control purposes. In CORS, a resource
is defined by the combination of URI and HTTP method. Once a client has obtained access information for a URI+METHOD,
it may cache it. JAX-RS, on the other hand, defines a resource as:
<ul>
<li>URI</li>
<li>method</li>
<li>Accepts</li>
<li>Accepts-Language</li>
<li>Content-Type</li>
</ul>
The logical place, in other words, to specify CORS policy in a JAX-RS application is at the level of an annotated method. However, each method is
applied to the narrow 'resource' defined by the list above, not just the URI+Method pair. This will motivate the annotation model below. 
</p>
<h2>Simple and Preflight requests</h2>
<p>The CORS specification differentiates two kinds of HTTP requests: <em>simple</em> and <em>not simple</em>. (See the specification
for the definition.) For a simple request, the client simply
sends the request to the service, and then looks for the <tt>Access-Control-</tt> headers to indicate whether the server has explicitly granted 
cross-origin access. For a non-simple request, the client sends a so-called <em>preflight</em> request and waits for a response before 
issuing the original request.
<h2>Configuration via Annotation</h2>
<p>
One way to control the behavior of the filter is the @{@link CrossOriginResourceSharing} annotation on a method. 
This is a complete solution for simple requests. You can specify all of the controls. However, if you have non-simple methods, the mismatch on 
resource access models above makes it impossible for CXF to map the OPTIONS request that will arrive to the correct method.
</p>
<p>
If all the methods of a class can share a common policy, you can attach a single @{@link CrossOriginResourceSharing} 
to a resource class, and it will apply to all the resource implied by all of the methods.
</p>
<p>
If you need finer control, you can use @{@link CrossOriginResourceSharingPaths} at the class level. This annotation contains a list of 
@{@link CrossOriginResourceSharing} annotations. In the nested annotations, you add <tt>path = "/localResourcePath"</tt> to associate the 
annotation with a path. The filter will find the annotation based on path, and then allow (or forbid) based on the method
as compared to the <tt>allowedMethods</tt>.
</p>
<h2>Bean Configuration</h2>
<p>
The simplest configuration applies when you want to apply the same configuration to all of your resources. In this case, you can
use the properties of {@link CrossOriginResourceSharingFilter} to specify the policy.
