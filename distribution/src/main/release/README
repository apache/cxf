Welcome to Apache CXF!
======================
Apache CXF is an open source services framework. CXF helps you build and 
develop services using frontend programming APIs, like JAX-WS. These 
services can speak a variety of protocols such as SOAP, XML/HTTP, RESTful 
HTTP, or CORBA and work over a variety of transports such as HTTP, JMS or JBI.

CXF includes a broad feature set, but it is primarily focused on the following 
areas:

    * Web Services Standards Support: CXF supports a variety of web service 
      standards including SOAP, the Basic Profile, WSDL, WS-Addressing, 
      WS-Policy, WS-ReliableMessaging, WS-Security, WS-SecurityPolicy,
      WS-SecureConversation, and WS-Trust.
    * Frontends: CXF supports a variety of "frontend" programming models. CXF
      implements the JAX-WS APIs. It also includes a "simple frontend" which 
      allows creation of clients and endpoints without annotations. CXF supports 
      both contract first development with WSDL and code first development 
      starting from Java.  There is also a preliminary JAX-RS frontend for 
      providing REST support.
    * Ease of use: CXF is designed to be intuitive and easy to use. There 
      are simple APIs to quickly build code-first services, Maven plug-ins to 
      make tooling integration easy, JAX-WS API support, Spring 2.x XML support 
      to make configuration a snap, and much more.
    * Binary and Legacy Protocol Support: CXF has been designed to provide a 
      pluggable architecture that supports not only XML but also non-XML type 
      bindings, such as JSON and CORBA, in combination with any type of transport.


Export Notice
============================
This distribution includes cryptographic software.  The country in 
which you currently reside may have restrictions on the import, 
possession, use, and/or re-export to another country, of 
encryption software.  BEFORE using any encryption software, please 
check your country's laws, regulations and policies concerning the

information.

The U.S. Government Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and
Security (BIS), has classified this software as Export Commodity 
Control Number (ECCN) 5D002.C.1, which includes information security
software using or performing cryptographic functions with asymmetric
algorithms.  The form and manner of this Apache Software Foundation
distribution makes it eligible for export under the License Exception
ENC Technology Software Unrestricted (TSU) exception (see the BIS 
Export Administration Regulations, Section 740.13) for both object 
code and source code.
