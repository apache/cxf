# Jakarta REST TCK

The **Jakarta REST TCK** is a standalone kit for testing compliance of an implementation with the Jakarta REST specification.

**Note:** This TCK contains *only* tests being added since Jakarta REST 3.0. To proof compliance as part of a certification review, additional test have to be performed. Those are part of the Jakarta Platform TCK for historic reasons.

## Performing Test

* Execute `mvn verify`.
* Find the test result as part of Maven's output on the console or refer to the surefire reports.
