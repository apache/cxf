JMS Transport Demo using Document-Literal Style
===============================================

This sample demonstrates use of the Document-Literal style
binding over JMS transport using the pub/sub mechanism.

Unlike the jms_queue sample, this web service provides only
the one-way message exchange pattern (greetMeOneWay), not
the standard request-response model because you cannot ordinarily
have a single response for a request that has multiple subscribers. 

Please review the README in the samples directory before
continuing.

This demo uses ActiveMQ Artemis as the JMS implementation for
illustration purposes only.
