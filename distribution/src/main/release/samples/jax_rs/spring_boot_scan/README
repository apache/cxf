== Spring Boot Scan Demo == 

This sample project demonstrates how to autodiscover and use CXF JAX-RS services and clients
with Spring Boot. 

Check eureka-registry/README on how to run Eureka Registry.

Check application/README on how to run a server application.

Note: 
You can have both the registry and the server application started by running "docker-compose up" in this directory.

By default it is expected that EUREKA_SERVER_URI environment variable is exported and set to 
"http://{docker.host}" where you can find the value of {docker.host} by running 'ifconfig' and checking 
the IP address of the docker bridge 'docker0'.

Alternatively you can edit docker-compose.yml and enable the 'host' network mode.
 

Check client/README on how to run a command line client.
