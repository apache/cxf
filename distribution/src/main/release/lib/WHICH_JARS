This directory includes the CXF jar, the CXF manifest jar, the required
dependencies, and many optional dependencies.

The 'manifest jar' is a jar containing only a MANIFEST.MF with a classpath
that calls in all the other jar.

!!Please note the following list is outdated and needs an update!!
Use the mvn dependency:list command to identify dependencies in the meantime.

The following jars are required for all CXF usage:
- cxf-core.jar
- geronimo-javamail.jar (Or the Sun equivalent) [7]
  (MAY be able to remove javamail if you don't use any MIME/MTOM/SAAJ type things)
- jaxb-api.jar  [7]
- jaxb-core.jar  [7]
- jaxb-impl.jar (this is a [7] for normal runtime, but is required for 
                 tooling and the dynamic clients)
- xmlschema-core.jar
- woodstox-core.jar
- stax2-api.jar
- slf4j-*.jar
- jcl-over-slf4j.jar

Note: woodstox and stax2-api can be removed if you set the 
"org.apache.cxf.stax.allowInsecureParser‚Äù system property to true.  This
is NOT recommended as it opens up various DOS attacks.
